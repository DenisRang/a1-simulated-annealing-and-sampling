# Assignment #1: Simulated Annealing and Sampling
* Implementation an optimization algorithm called Simulated Annealing (SA). It is based on sampling and the optimization procedure is similar to the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm.
* The first task is fitting the neural network using SA as an optimization method. Then comparing the results with traditional fitting using back-propagation.
* Due to the nature of this optimization approach, it does not require the function to be differentiable. This allows to apply this method to optimize combinatorial problems. So the second task is finding the optimal traveling salesman path using SA for 30 Russian cities.
* Red is initial path, green is the final path.
